To run, open "GAN" directory and use command "python main.py --base_cfg_path configs/experiments/CIFAR10_MNIST.json --cfg_path configs/unconditional/WGAN.json" and adjust "range_penalty_strength" and "dataroot" parameters under "configs/experiments/CIFAR10_MNIST.json" as well as "ngpu" under "configs/unconditional/WGAN.json" as desired. Experiments were performed using PyTorch 1.10.2, NumPy 1.21.2, torchvision 0.11.3, and cvxpy 1.2.1 (though this last package is only needed to run model of Balaji et al.)
